1. projects page no white hover on boxes.
2. mobile- top bg is too short
2.5. mobile icon needs more style
3. coloring of mobile menu is a bit weak- on original template as well.
4. about page spaces are a bit weird- maybe consilidate a bit.
5. overall- recheck all font sizes, weights, more precision req.
6. revert custom fields (projects page) into normal meta boxes
7. better compression & js support to old browser (bavel) through webpack
